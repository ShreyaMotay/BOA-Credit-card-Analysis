# Bank of America Marketing Strategy

## Introduction
This project presents a marketing strategy analysis for Bank of America (BOA), focusing on customer segmentation based on credit card usage. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on 9,000 Bank of America credit card holders over the last 6 months. There are 18 variables, including customer ID, balance details, transaction types, payment patterns, and credit card usage frequency. These variables are crucial for understanding customer behavior and building segmentation models.

Key Variables:
- **CUST_ID**: Credit card holder ID (Categorical)
- **BALANCE**: Balance amount left in the account
- **PURCHASES**: Number of purchases made
- **CREDIT_LIMIT**: Userâ€™s credit card limit
- **TENURE**: Length of time using BOA credit card services

## Data Summary and Structure
The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis by:
1. Converting `CUST_ID` to a factor type for efficient analysis.
2. Removing irrelevant columns like `CUST_ID` to streamline the analysis process.
3. Plotting key visualizations, such as histograms, to explore the distribution of purchases.
